We have created a tool that creates a autoregressive and probabilistic forecasting time series model and 
provides help using it.

It enables creation by providing:
. Assisted feature selection
. Feature transformation
. Model selection
. Model evaluation through metrics on the whole test set and specific points in the test set 
. Model Use through a tested visualization method
