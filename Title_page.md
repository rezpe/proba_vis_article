Abstract:

There are few studies dealing with visualization techniques applied to uncertainty in time series, where the evolution of uncertainty over time is relevant. After reviewing the existing literature on the field, we found 3 visualization techniques we could apply to this case: the gradient chart, the box plot, and the confidence interval charts. We also applied the frequency framing technique to design a fourth and novel way to visualize uncertainty in time series: the natural frequency chart. We compared those charts against a predefined set of metrics around the user's ability to estimate the outcome  probabilities at certain times (accuracy, time to read, confidence and, perceived difficulty) and we devised a social experiment through Amazon Mechanical Turk to evaluate the different charts. From the results of our experiments, we can conclude that the application of natural frequencies does indeed provide better readability than any of the alternatives.
