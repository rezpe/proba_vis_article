\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Hothorn \emph{et al.} stated that the real
objective in a machine learning regression analysis is to find the full conditional distribution
of the target variable. Currently, many machine learning models today only provide a point distribution, 
which is usually the predicted
mean of the target variable. Then the users of the model must take a decision based on the value predicted. 
However, only point information without uncertainty creates a false sense of deterministic result that can lead 
to false confidence in the decision. That's why as noted by Fernandez et Al., uncertainty improves decision making. 
However, the typical visualization tools that users rely on are not suited for probabilistic information, 
as they are designed for deterministic information. This also adds an additional difficulty for this charts. Users do not read
a single value but have to determine the probability of the target value within a certain range.

If we focus on categorical data, the standard visualization is the bar chart. This visualization uses a rectangle as marker and 
encodes the category as the x-axis and the target value as the y-axis (or vice versa). If we wish to add probabilistic information 
to the chart, we could add error bars to the already present bars. However as noted by Kai et Al. 
the information has to be intrinsic to the visualization. Therefore we need a different way to display the uncertainty in the target.

Several approaches exist already. The most straightforward solution is the violin plot which displays the probability density function for each category. As Fernandez et Al. states, users do not tend to have enough statistical knowledge to interpret this type of chart making it difficult to extract information. The other solution is the box plot, introduced by Tukey et al. in 1977. This type of chart uses a rectangle which top and bottom parts show the 1st and 3rd quantile of the target value for each category and a line to show the 2nd quantile. This chart is much simpler to read and has been showcased as the main solution to show uncertainty or probability distribution. The boxen plot brings additional rectangle per category that enable to show more percentiles than the box plot.

\section{Time Series probabilistic charts}
\label{sec:time_series}

Time series data representation could be a subset of categorical data visualization where the categories are the ordered time slots. Therefore, we could apply the solutions seen above to represent probabilistic time series data. Usually the number of time categories
is high and we have to deal with limited space per category. Therefore, this constraint rules out the violin plot. However, the use of boxen plots for time series has been showcased specially for EPS diagrams, very used for meteorological data.

However, time series data have usually been represented with a dedicated type of chart: line charts, where the marker is a 
line where the x-axis represent time and the y-axis represents the target value. Also, we could use error bars to represent uncertainty,
but other intrinsic solutions are being used. The first one is to represent the confidence interval, where instead of a single line, we 
will draw 3 lines: the first one for the 5\% percentile, the second one for the mean and the third one for the 95\% percentile. 
Another solution is the gradient chart where colour areas represent each of the deciles of the probabilistic time series.

However Kai et Al. investigation noted that users prefer to think in terms of natural frecuencies (2/10) instead 
of probabilities (.2), and therefore it's better to use discrete outcomes to communicate probabilities. All the charts above 
represent probabilities or percentile and a discrete solution would improve readability and understanding of the charts: We
propose therefore a novel visualization technique to show time series data: time series dot plot. 

This chart would draw a dot for each of the deciles of the target variable. This simplifies the readability of the chart as
users just need to count the number of dots to estimate approximately the natural frequencies.

Figure \ref{figure:charts} shows a summary of the main types of probabilistic time series charts.

\subsection{Application: No levels forecast in Madrid}

Air quality has become a concern in recent years and lately pollution peaks have forced local authorities to take measures like cutting traffic or blocking certain city areas. Those measures are purely reactive and therefore a forecast of pollution might be preferrable as proactive measures could be taken and prevent the pollution peak before it happens.

Several stations in Madrid record the levels of NO in different parts of the city. We use a probabilistic
machine learning model to predict the levels of No in one of the stations. Instead of providing a point estimate, it provides a probability distribution at each of the prediction horizons. We represent the predictions. in a chart. This chart will be used by the authorities whenever a decision must be reached regarding the levels of pollution and preventive actions to be taken.

\section{Experimental Design}
\label{sec:exp_design}

We would like to compare 4 different types of charts displaying a probabilistic time series forecast. For this, we will evaluate how well the charts can help answering a probability question regarding the NO levels. We will request the participation of users through the Amazon Mechanical Turk website. Those users will perform a small task in exchange for a small fee (few dollars). The assigned task is a test where we measure how well can the participants read the charts. As seen in cite, we are selecting Masters Level Participants.

For each type of chart, we designed a test. Each test has a presentation part where we explain how the charts works and how it can be read and a questions part with 5 probability questions. Figure X shows the presentation part of the time series dot chart. The questions require reading the chart to estimate the probability of the NO levels inside a certain interval. We will measure for each question the error in the estimation and the time it took to answer. Inspired by the work of /cite, we are also asking at the end of the survey how difficult was reading the chart and answering the questions and how confident are they with their answers. Brenner et al. called this the load and confidence of each chart.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Figure \ref{figure:errors} shows the histogram of errors for each type of chart. As we can see, the time series dot chart is clearly superior to the other charts as most of the errors are around the zero value. We will use the rank order statistic to order the performance of each type of visualization. Figure X shows the rank. We did not see an improvement in the error rate as users were answering questions.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{probability_errors}
  \caption{\label{figure:errors}Distribution of absolute error for all questions per type of chart.}
\end{figure}

We also see in figure \ref{figure:duration} that for every chart, the time it takes to read and answer the question decreases for every question answered. We also did not see noticeable difference between the charts. However, the difficulty of reading the chart might impact this number for a higher number of questions.

  \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{duration_evo}
  \caption{\label{figure:duration} Median Time it took to answer each question for each of the types of chart.}
\end{figure}  

Confidence and load also prove the superior performance of the time series dot chart. Figure \ref{figure:confi_load} shows how the dot chart reports higher levels of confidence and lower levels of load of difficulty.

\begin{figure}

   \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{confi_load}
  \caption{\label{figure:confi_load} Difficulty (left) and Confidence (right) in reading and answering the questions for each chart}
\end{figure}

We also see a lack of statistical knowledge from standard users as some users were reporting probabilities above 1, showing they do not understand the basic theory of statistics. We reported 9 users from 80 whose answers could not be used as their answers could not be applicable (probability higher than 100 o text).
