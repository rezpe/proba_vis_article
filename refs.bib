	abstract = {We develop a graphical interpretation of ternary probabilistic forecasts in which forecasts and observations are regarded as points inside a triangle. Within the triangle, we define a continuous colour palette in which hue and colour saturation are defined with reference to the observed climatology. In contrast to current methods, forecast maps created with this colour scheme convey all of the information present in each ternary forecast. The geometrical interpretation is then extended to verification under quadratic scoring rules (of which the Brier score and the ranked probability score are well-known examples). Each scoring rule dennes an associated triangle in which the square roots of the score, the reliability, the uncertainty and the resolution all have natural interpretations as root mean square distances. This leads to our proposal for a ternary reliability diagram in which data relating to verification and calibration can be summarized. We illustrate these ideas with data relating to seasonal forecasting of precipitation in South America, including an example of nonlinear forecast calibration. Codes implementing these ideas have been produced using the statistical software package R and are available from the authors.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic weather forecasting consists of finding a joint probability distribution for future weather quantities or events. It is typically done by using a numerical weather prediction model, perturbing the inputs to the model in various ways, and running the model for each perturbed set of inputs. The result is then viewed as an ensemble of forecasts, taken to be a sample from the joint probability distribution of the future weather quantities of interest. This is typically not feasible for mesoscale weather prediction carried out locally by organizations without the vast data and computing resources of national weather centers. Instead, we propose a simpler method that breaks with much previous practice by perturbing the outputs, or deterministic forecasts, from the model. Forecast errors are modeled using a geostatistical model, and ensemble members are generated by simulating realizations of the geostatistical model. The method is applied to 48-hour mesoscale forecasts of temperature in the North American Pacific Northwest between 2000 and 2002. The resulting forecast intervals turn out to be empirically well calibrated for individual meteorological quantities, to be sharper than those obtained from approximate climatology, and to be consistent with aspects of the spatial correlation structure of the observations.},

Climate forecast providers face the challenge of communicating the uncertainty inherent in these forecasts to these decision-makers in a way that is transparent, understandable and does not lead to a false sense of certainty. This article reports the findings of a user-needs survey, conducted with 50 representatives of organizations in Europe from a variety of sectors (e.g. water management, forestry, energy, tourism, health) interested in seasonal and interannual climate forecasts. We find that while many participating organizations perform their own 'in house' risk analysis most require some form of processing and interpretation by forecast providers. However, we also find that while users tend to perceive seasonal and interannual forecasts to be useful, they often find them difficult to understand, highlighting the need for communication formats suitable for both expert and non-expert users. In addition, our results show that people tend to prefer familiar formats for receiving information about uncertainty. The implications of these findings for both the providers and users of climate information are discussed.},

Our analysis is informed both by research progress and by our own experience in an ongoing industrial case study on modelling and mapping underground assets, where it would appear that uncertainty plays a major role. In this case study, we try to identify promoting and limiting factors. We conclude that the value of uncertainty visualization is severely limited by the quality and scope of uncertainty data, by the limited confidence in the data itself, and by the perceptual and cognitive confusion that the depiction of this data can generate. We hope to broaden the discussion on the utility of uncertainty in visualization from the purely technical and perceptual issues to social and organizational factors.},

In a first study, we show how applying a Bayesian cognition model to a simple visualization scenario indicates that people's judgments are consistent with a hypothesis that they are doing approximate Bayesian inference. In a second study, we evaluate how sensitive our observations of Bayesian behavior are to different techniques for eliciting people subjective distributions, and to different datasets. We find that people don't behave consistently with Bayesian predictions for large sample size datasets, and this difference cannot be explained by elicitation technique. In a final study, we show how normative Bayesian inference can be used as an evaluation framework for visualizations, including of uncertainty.},

In total, 44 users played 991 turns. We analyzed the turns by logging game metrics such as the gain per turn and included a survey element. The results show that abundance of uncertainty information leads to taking unnecessary risks. However, representations with aggregated detailed uncertainty provide a good trade-off between being understandable by the players and encouraging medium risks with high gains. Absence of uncertainty information reduces the risk taking and leads to more won turns, but with the lowest money gain.},

We present a novel mobile interface design and visualization of uncertainty for transit predictions on mobile phones based on discrete outcomes. To develop it, we identified domain specific design requirements for visualizing uncertainty in transit prediction through: 1) a literature review, 2) a large survey of users of a popular realtime transit application, and 3) an iterative design process. We present several candidate visualizations of uncertainty for realtime transit predictions in a mobile context, and we propose a novel discrete representation of continuous outcomes designed for small screens, quantile dotplots. In a controlled experiment we find that quantile dotplots reduce the variance of probabilistic estimates by {\textasciitilde}1.15 times compared to density plots and facilitate more confident estimation by end-users in the context of realtime transit prediction scenarios.},

It aims to portray information about the decision problem and facilitate its analysis and exploration at different levels of detail. It also aims to facilitate the integration of uncertainty and risk into the decision-making process and allow users to experiment with multiple "what-if" scenarios. We evaluate the utility of {VisIDM} through a qualitative user study. The results provide valuable insights into the benefits and drawbacks of {VisIDM} for assisting people to make informed decisions and raising their awareness of uncertainty and risk involved in their decisions.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we define distributions as a new data type and address the challenges of visualizing spatial distribution data sets. Numerous visualization techniques exist today for dealing with scalar data. That is, there is a scalar value at each spatial location, which may also be changing over time. Likewise, techniques exist for dealing with vector, tensor and multivariate data sets. However, there is currently no systematic way of dealing with distribution data where there is a collection of values for the same variable at every location and time. Distribution data is increasingly becoming more common as computers and sensor technologies continue to improve. They have also been used in a number of fields ranging from agriculture, engineering design and manufacturing to weather forecasting. Rather than developing specialized visualization techniques for dealing with distribution data, the approach presented in this paper is to find a systematic way of extending existing visualization methods to handle this new data type. For example, we would like to be able to generate isosurfaces of 3D scalar distribution data sets, or generate streamlines of vector distribution data sets. In order to accomplish this goal, we propose the use of a set of mathematically and procedurally defined operators that allow us to work directly on distributions.

Visualization research has often overlooked the errors and uncertainty which accompany the scientific process and describe key characteristics used to fully understand the data. The lack of these representations can be attributed, in part, to the inherent difficulty in defining, characterizing, and controlling this uncertainty, and in part, to the difficulty in including additional visual metaphors in a well designed, potent display. However, the exclusion of this information cripples the use of visualization as a decision making tool due to the fact that the display is no longer a true representation of the data. This systematic omission of uncertainty commands fundamental research within the visualization community to address, integrate, and expect uncertainty information. In this chapter, we outline sources and models of uncertainty, give an overview of the state-of-the-art, provide general guidelines, outline small exemplary applications, and finally, discuss open problems in uncertainty visualization.},

It is generally important to be able to visualize those uncertainties, and especially to be able to quickly focus on areas where there is considerable disagreement. The follow-up interpretation of visualized uncertainty can be very helpful in some cases. Czech Hydrometeorological Institute provides a lot of datasets from more than 250 stations. The article is focused on potential effective ways of the interpolation and visualization of uncertainty of the temperature time-series datasets which are also one of the most traditionally measured data. A final comparing of the interpolation and interpretation are based on the uncertainty visualization which are relatively new approaches used in the geographical research but their potential has been already proven by wide usage in {GIS} analysis. The evaluation of interpolation methods as well as geographic data orderliness according to the uncertainty visualization is accomplished and discussed in the paper. Subsequent visualization of analysed phenomenon using this approach brings augmented and more accurate (geo) information to the user, which helps to better decision.},

Recently the visualization community has risen to the challenge of incorporating an indication of uncertainty into visual representations, and in this article we review their work. We place the work in the context of a reference model for data visualization, that sees data pass through a pipeline of processes. This allows us to distinguish the visualization of uncertaintyâwhich considers how we depict uncertainty specified with the dataâand the uncertainty of visualizationâwhich considers how much inaccuracy occurs as we process data through the pipeline. It has taken some time for uncertain visualization methods to be developed, and we explore why uncertainty visualization is hardâone explanation is that we typically need to find another display dimension and we may have used these up already! To organize the material we return to a typology developed by one of us in the early days of visualization, and make use of this to present a catalog of visualization techniques describing the research that has been done to extend each method to handle uncertainty. Finally we note the responsibility on us all to incorporate any known uncertainty into a visualization, so that integrity of the discipline is maintained.},

In this paper an innovative approach to enable modeling and communication of uncertain properties along the product life cycle and the sophisticated presentation and visualization of these uncertainties is proposed. This approach is based on a three layer concept including a representation layer, a presentation layer and a visualization layer. The approach enables the visualization of a broad spectrum of process and product properties with respect to different specifications of each property e.g. single values, intervals, fuzziness and stochastic measures which may occur along the product life cycle.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an empirical study that addresses the effects the visualization of uncertainty has on decision-making. We focus our investigations on an area where uncertainty plays an important role and the decision time is limited. For that, we selected an air defense scenario, where expert operators have a few minutes to make a well-informed decision based on uncertain sensor data regarding the identity of an object and where the consequences of a late or wrong decision are severe. An approach for uncertainty visualization is proposed and tested using a prototype that supports the interactive analysis of multivariate spatio-temporal sensor data. The uncertainty visualization embeds the accuracy of the sensor data values using the thickness of the lines in the graphical representation of the sensor values. Semi-transparent filled circles represent the uncertain position, while a track quality value between 0 and 1 accounts for the quality of the estimated track for each target. Twenty-two experienced air traffic operators were divided into two groups (with and without uncertainty visualization) and carried out identification and prioritization tasks using the prototype. The results show that the group aided by visualizations of uncertainty needed significantly fewer attempts to make a final identification, and a significant difference between the groups when considering the identities and priorities assigned was observed (participants with uncertainty visualization selected higher priority values and more hostile and suspect identities). These results may show that experts put themselves in the âworst-case scenarioâ in the presence of uncertainty when safety is an issue. Additionally, the presentation of uncertainty neither increased the participants×³ expressed workload, nor the time needed to make a classification. However, the inclusion of the uncertainty information did not have a significant effect on the performance (true positives, false negatives and false positives) or the participants×³ expressed confidence in their decisions.},

As many artificial intelligent systems require a human-in-the-loop who is able to actively take part in the analysis process, the understanding of high-level cognition involved in human-graph interaction is essential in the design of better tools for analysis. In this research, we investigate the visual behaviour that is associated with participants responses to problems testing probabilistic reasoning represented through two different visualizations (tree and Venn diagrams). Using the data from visual fixations and transitions, we present a description of different reasoning strategies covering both accurate and inaccurate reasoning for different visualization formats. The results show that gaze behaviour is related to reasoning accuracy. Moreover, this study shows that different graphs representing the same problem evoke different reasoning strategies, suggesting that higher level cognition is influenced by the graphical representation in which uncertainty is encoded.},

But findings on if and how users can incorporate this information into spatial analyses are still rare. In this paper we address these questions with a focus on land cover change analysis. We conducted semi-structured interviews with three expert groups dealing with change analysis in the fields of climate research, urban development, and vegetation monitoring. During the interviews we used a software prototype to show change scenarios that the experts had analyzed before, extended by visual depiction of uncertainty related to land cover change. This paper describes the study, summarizes results, and discusses findings as well as the study method. Participants came up with several ideas for applications that could be supported by uncertainty, for example, identification of erroneous change, description of change detection algorithm characteristics, or optimization of change detection parameters. Regarding the aspect of reasoning with uncertainty in land cover change data the interviewees saw potential in better-informed hypotheses and insights about change. Communication of uncertainty information to users was seen as critical, depending on the usersâ role and expertize. We judge semi-structured interviews to be suitable for the purpose of this study and emphasize the potential of qualitative methods (workshops, focus groups etc.) for future uncertainty visualization studies.},

	abstract = {This paper examines methodologies for dynamically displaying information about uncertainty. Modeling uncertainty in elevation data results in the generation of dozens or hundreds of realizations of the elevation surface. Producing animations of these surfaces is an approach to exploratory data visualization that may assist the researcher in understanding the effect of uncertainty on spatial applications as well as in communicating the results of the research to a wider audience. A nonlinear method for interpolation between the surface realizations is introduced which allows for smooth animation while maintaining the surface characteristics prescribed by the uncertainty model.},

abstract =     {The ultimate goal of regression analysis is to
				obtain information about the conditional
				distribution of a response given a set of
				explanatory variables. This goal is, however, seldom
				achieved because most established regression models
				estimate only the conditional mean as a function of
				the explanatory variables and assume that higher
				moments are not affected by the regressors. The
				underlying reason for such a restriction is the
				assumption of additivity of signal and noise. We
				propose to relax this common assumption in the
				framework of transformation models. The novel class
				of semiparametric regression models proposed herein
				allows transformation functions to depend on
				explanatory variables. These transformation
				functions are estimated by regularized optimization
				of scoring rules for probabilistic forecasts,
				e.g. the continuous ranked probability score. The
				corresponding estimated conditional distribution
				functions are consistent. Conditional transformation
				models are potentially useful for describing
				possible heteroscedasticity, comparing spatially
				varying distributions, identifying extreme events,
				deriving prediction intervals and selecting
				variables beyond mean regression effects. An
				empirical investigation based on a heteroscedastic
				varying-coefficient simulation model demonstrates
				that semiparametric estimation of conditional
				distribution functions can be more beneficial than
				kernel-based non-parametric approaches or parametric
				generalized additive models for location, scale and
				shape.},
