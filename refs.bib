	abstract = {Today's data visualization tools offer few capabilities and no representational standards for conveying uncertainty. Our aim is to remedy this by creating a visual vocabulary for uncertainty in data. However, we must first develop an extensible methodology for validating the effectiveness of uncertainty visualization techniques. In this paper we describe a test instrument we have developed to collect empirical data concerning four measures - accuracy, response time, reported confidence, and cognitive load - that can be used to evaluate techniques for visualizing data with uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Abstract Modern operational methods of numerical weather prediction, such as “ensemble forecasting,” allow assessments of state-dependent predictability to be made. This means that forecast-specific estimates of the forecast standard errors are possible. Quantitative estimates of forecast uncertainty are often not communicated to the public as it is unclear what the value of this information will be to people who must make weather-dependent decisions. Using laboratory-based methods developed by experimental economists to study individual choice it is found that nonspecialists are able to make better decisions that increase their expected reward while reducing their exposure to risk, when provided with information about the day-to-day uncertainty associated with temperature forecasts. The experimental framework used herein may provide a useful tool for evaluating the effectiveness with which weather forecasts can be communicated to end users.},

	abstract = {This paper provides an overview of uncertainty visualization in general, along with specific examples of applications in bioinformatics. Starting from a processing and interaction pipeline of visualization, components are discussed that are relevant for handling and visualizing uncertainty introduced with the original data and at later stages in the pipeline, which shows the importance of making the stages of the pipeline aware of uncertainty and allowing them to propagate uncertainty. We detail concepts and methods for visual mappings of uncertainty, distinguishing between explicit and implict representations of distributions, different ways to show summary statistics, and combined or hybrid visualizations. The basic concepts are illustrated for several examples of graph visualization under uncertainty. Finally, this review paper discusses implications for the visualization of biological data and future research directions.},

Authors of journal articles in psychology, behavioral neuroscience, and medicine were invited to visit a Web site where they adjusted a figure until they judged 2 means, with error bars, to be just statistically significantly different (p {\textless} .05). Results from 473 respondents suggest that many leading researchers have severe misconceptions about how error bars relate to statistical significance, do not adequately distinguish CIs and SE bars, and do not appreciate the importance of whether the 2 means are independent or come from a repeated measures design. Better guidelines for researchers and less ambiguous graphical conventions are needed before the advantages of CIs for research communication can be realized.},

	abstract = {Time series forecasts are ubiquitous, ranging from daily weather forecasts to projections of pandemics such as COVID-19. Communicating the uncertainty associated with such forecasts is important, because it may affect users’ trust in a forecasting model and, in turn, the decisions made based on the model. Although there exists a growing body of research on visualizing uncertainty in general, the important case of visualizing prediction uncertainty in time series forecasting is under-researched. Against this background, we investigated how different visualizations of predictive uncertainty affect the extent to which people follow predictions of a time series forecasting model. More specifically, we conducted an online experiment on forecasting occupied hospital beds due to the COVID-19 pandemic, measuring the influence of uncertainty visualization of algorithmic predictions on participants’ own predictions. In contrast to prior studies, our empirical results suggest that more salient visualizations of uncertainty lead to decreased willingness to follow algorithmic forecasts.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty is an inherent part of knowledge, and yet in an era of contested expertise, many shy away from openly communicating their uncertainty about what they know, fearful of their audience's reaction. But what effect does communication of such epistemic uncertainty have? Empirical research is widely scattered across many disciplines. This interdisciplinary review structures and summarizes current practice and research across domains, combining a statistical and psychological perspective. This informs a framework for uncertainty communication in which we identify three objects of uncertainty—facts, numbers and science—and two levels of uncertainty: direct and indirect. An examination of current practices provides a scale of nine expressions of direct uncertainty. We discuss attempts to codify indirect uncertainty in terms of quality of the underlying evidence. We review the limited literature about the effects of communicating epistemic uncertainty on cognition, affect, trust and decision-making. While there is some evidence that communicating epistemic uncertainty does not necessarily affect audiences negatively, impact can vary between individuals and communication formats. Case studies in economic statistics and climate change illustrate our framework in action. We conclude with advice to guide both communicators and future researchers in this important but so far rather neglected field.},
