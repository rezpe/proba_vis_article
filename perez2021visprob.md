# TLDR

We have created a tool that creates a autoregressive and probabilistic forecasting time series model and 
provides help using it.

It enables creation by providing:
. Assisted feature selection
. Feature transformation
. Model selection
. Model evaluation through metrics on the whole test set and specific points in the test set 
. Model Use through a tested visualization method
. Timeline Visualization of all user interactions that:
    . let the user see the improvements in model performance in a histogram way
    . provide information to go back to previous steps

We compare this interactive method with a full automated one and we see an improvement in metrics and a much shorter training time. 

# Introduction

Interactive ML articles

There are lots of studies on automatic feature selection techniques and automatic ML model. Also TPOT that lets you compare whole pipelines.

No visualization on the final process - Only a number
No use of statistical tools for the comparison
No user guidance on the process
No visualization of the process
